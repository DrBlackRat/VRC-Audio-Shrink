### What does this do?
- Scales your Avatar based on AudioLink
- Select what AudioLink Band to react to
- Set a default scale
- Set a max amplitude scale
- Safe Zones in which you are unaffected by scaling
- Master Only settings
  - Master Disable (disables AudioShrink for everyone)
  - Master Control (Master sets AudioBand, Default & Max Amplitude Scale for everyone)
  - Sync Settings (AudioBand, Default & Max Amplitude Scale)

### Safety Info:

Since this can be quite nausea inducing I made extra sure that it's safe to use!
- It will always be off by default no matter what you do
- Only you can enable it for yourself
- There are Safe Zones you can set up in which this system will be disabled

### How to set it up:
- If you get a popup about TextMeshPro missing, install it as well as it's example assets
- Make sure you have the latest AudioLink version installed

AudioShrink:
- Drag the AudioShrink Prefab into your scene
- Position the prefab where ever you want the control panel to be

Safe Zones:
- Put Safe Zones where ever you want people to not be affected by AudioShrink
  - The AudioShrink Prefab / Control Panel already comes with one attached
- You can have as many as you want of them
- If they are next to each other make sure they overlap a bit
